## What is Three.js?

[**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) is a **cross-browser JavaScript library** and **Application Programming Interface (API)** used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It is built on top of WebGL, which provides powerful hardware-accelerated 3D rendering. 

Three.js makes it easy for developers to create rich, interactive 3D experiences directly in a web browser, without needing in-depth knowledge of WebGL.

### Features of Three.js:
- **Scene Graph**: Three.js provides a way to easily manage objects in a 3D scene, such as lights, cameras, and meshes.
- **Built-in Geometries**: You can easily create spheres, cubes, planes, and other basic geometries.
- **Materials and Shaders**: Three.js supports a wide range of material types (basic, phong, lambert, etc.) and lets you create custom shaders using GLSL.
- **Animation and Physics**: Animate your objects and bring them to life with built-in support for animation and basic physics interactions.
- **Lighting Models**: Three.js supports different types of lights such as ambient, point, directional, and spotlights.
- **Customizable Camera Views**: Use perspectives, orthographic cameras, and even custom controls.

## Three.js Basic Structure

A simple Three.js project consists of the following elements:

1. **Scene**: The container that holds all the 3D objects, lights, and cameras.
2. **Camera**: Determines what part of the scene is visible on the screen.
3. **Renderer**: Renders the scene onto a canvas using WebGL.
4. **Objects**: Meshes, geometries, and materials that represent 3D objects in your scene.
